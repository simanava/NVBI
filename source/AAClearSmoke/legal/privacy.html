<strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Total White. We are committed to protecting your privacy and encourage you to periodically review this page to be informed of how we protect the information you disclose to us. If you believe that Total White site is not abiding by our posted privacy policy, please contact us.<br><br>

<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><br>
Total White is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Your privacy is important to us. We will never trade, lease or sell your e-mail address or personal information. Total White collects information from our users at several different points on our website. No personal information will be shared with any third parties without the customer's permission.<br><br>

<strong>Order</strong><br>
We request information from the user on our order form when making a purchase. Here is where a user must provide their contact information, such as name and postal address, and financial information, like credit card number and expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill the customer's order. If we have difficulty processing an order, this contact information is used to communicate with the customer.<br><br>

<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. We use both session and persistent cookies. Usage of a cookie from our site is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users in the aggregate by analysing popular areas and products to enhance future experiences on our site.<br><br>

<strong>Usage Tracking</strong><br>
Total White's database tracks the traffic throughout our site. This information is used to compile overall statistics and is not recorded at an individual level. This includes IP (internet protocol) addresses, browser type, ISP (internet service provider), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and # of clicks to analyse trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate. The statistics help us decide which products and services best serve our members and guests.<br><br>

<strong>Aggregate Information</strong><br>
Total White uses aggregate information from demographic surveys, traffic patterns and IP addresses to customize our site. Aggregate information is occasionally shared with partners of Total White to plan advertising or promotions. We do not share any personally identifiable information.<br><br>

<strong>Sharing</strong><br>
Total White uses a partner postage company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br><br>

<strong>Links</strong><br>
This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by Total White.<br><br>

<strong>Security</strong><br>
Total White takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via our website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or National Insurance Number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - Secure Socket Layers (SSLs). While on a secure page, such as our order form, a lock icon appears on the bottom of your Web browser. When you are not on a secure page, no lock icon will appear.<br><br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information (like your credit card information) online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are fully informed about our security and privacy practices and updated as new policies are added or revised. They are regularly notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure that our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment under restricted access.<br><br>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact Customer Support.<br><br>

<strong>Special Offers</strong><br>
Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special offers and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice/opt-out below.<br><br>

<strong>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating</strong><br>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your post code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate that user's personally identifiable information provided to us. This can be done by using the unsubscribe feature in our communication or by contacting Customer Support.
